## Features

- **User Interface**: A clean, user-friendly interface that allows for easy navigation and operation of the student registration system.
- **Registration Form**: Users can enter details such as student name, ID, class, roll number, address, contact details, and email.
- **Display of Registered Details**: After registering, users can view the details of registered students in a dedicated section.

## Current Limitations

- **Lack of Persistence**: The current version of the application does not support data persistence since it does not implement local storage or any form of database. This means that all data entered into the form will be lost once the page is refreshed or closed.

## Future Improvements

- **Local Storage Integration**: Future versions will aim to incorporate local storage to retain data even after the browser session ends. This enhancement will improve data persistence and usability.


## Why No Local Storage Yet?

As of the current state, I have not studied how local storage works, which is why this feature has not been added to the project yet. Learning and implementing local storage is on my immediate roadmap to enhance the functionality of this application.
